# sequential_version
This code will generate a random 10 by 10 matrix with floating point numbers in the range of -10 to 10 (inclusive), write it to a file called "matrix.txt", read in the matrix from the file, determine the indices of the columns where the number of negative elements is twice as large as the number of zeros, and print the indices of those columns.
